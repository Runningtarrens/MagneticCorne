# Preface

If you build a lot of keyboards or repair them, you know the hassle of having to open the cases, screw/ unscrew and taking apart the whole thing everytime you need to reflow a solder point, an led or maybe even just reset the MCU. Also for any corne build youll need to have about 20 screws and 5 standoffs per half to just keep the halfs together. With the MagneticCorne you dont need to unscrew anything to access the PCB or any screw or standoff to use this case. The Case supports magnetic tenting legs and provides tenting holes for other tenting methods.

# Bill of Materials

To print this case youll need:
* about 120 gramms of Filament
* 16 Neodymium Magnets (14mm x 4mm x 2,5mm)
*  (Optional) 4 Neodymiom Magnets round (10mm x 1mm)

# How to print
 
 
Youll probably need to scale the files up to 1000%, because my CAD programm always exports in cm instead of mm, just for your information.
I always print in PLA, but you can use any filament for the case. 

### Slicing

#### Settings for the Print:

* 0.10 layer hight
* 3 Parimeters
* 3 Top and Bottom layers
* 15% Infill
* 205°C Filament temp
* 60°C Bed Temp

#### Getting the magnets in

To get the magnets in, the M600 command is used. The printer makes a pause and removes the filament from the extruder. While the print is pause, the magnets can be put into the pockets. Its important that you check and double check the polarity of the magnets, so that the halfs stick to eack other and dont repell each other.

The print is paused in on the top half after the 42 layer or 4.2mm hight.
