# Preface

If you build a lot of keyboards or repair them, you know the hassle of having to open the cases, screw/ unscrew and taking apart the whole thing everytime you need to reflow a solder point, an led or maybe even just reset the MCU. Also for any corne build youll need to have about 20 screws and 5 standoffs per half to just keep the halfs together. With the MagneticCorne you dont need to unscrew anything to access the PCB or any screw or standoff to use this case. The Case supports magnetic tenting legs and provides tenting holes for other tenting methods.
